This blockchain is for educational purposes only and should not be used for production purposes in its current state. As the application matures and meets standards, then at that point it can be used for production purposes.

### Compilation

TypeScript is used for the source code of the application. The source code is then "compiled" into raw JavaScript and placed in the "build" folder.

See: tsconfig.json

### Jest

Jest is used to test the applicaiton code. However, Babel is required in order to support TypeScript when testing the source code.
